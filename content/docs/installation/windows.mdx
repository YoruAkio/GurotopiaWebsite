# Windows Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up Gurotopia on Windows 10/11.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to install the following tools:

### 1. MSYS2

[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) provides a Unix-like environment on Windows with package management.

1. Download the installer from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Note the installation path (default: `C:\msys64`)

### 2. Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor for development.

1. Download VSCode from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

## Install Dependencies

Open your MSYS2 folder (e.g., `C:\msys64`) and launch `ucrt64.exe`. Then run:

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-{gcc,openssl,sqlite} make
```

This installs:
- **GCC** - The GNU Compiler Collection for C/C++
- **OpenSSL** - For SSL/TLS encryption
- **SQLite** - Lightweight database engine
- **Make** - Build automation tool

## Compile the Server

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gurotopia/Gurotopia.git
cd Gurotopia
```

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code

3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to start the build process

<Callout type="info">
The build process will compile all source files and create the server executable.
</Callout>

## Run the Server

After successful compilation:

1. Press `F5` to run the server with the debugger attached
2. The server will start and listen for connections

<Callout type="warn">
Make sure to configure your hosts file before connecting. See the [Configuration](/docs/configuration) guide.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "command not found"

Make sure MSYS2's bin directory is in your system PATH:
- Add `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` to your environment variables

### Missing dependencies

Run the pacman command again to ensure all packages are installed:
```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-{gcc,openssl,sqlite} make
```

### VSCode can't find compiler

1. Open VSCode settings
2. Search for "C_Cpp.default.compilerPath"
3. Set it to `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\gcc.exe`
