# Welcome to Gurotopia

**グロートピア** *(Gurotopia)* is a lightweight and actively maintained Growtopia Private Server (GTPS) written in modern C/C++.

## What is Gurotopia?

Gurotopia is an open-source project that allows you to run your own Growtopia private server. Unlike other GTPS sources that are based on leaked code or outdated frameworks, Gurotopia is built from scratch with:

- **Modern C++ standards** - Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **Lightweight footprint** - Compiler + SSL + SQL under 1GB
- **Active maintenance** - Regular updates and community support
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on both Windows and Linux
