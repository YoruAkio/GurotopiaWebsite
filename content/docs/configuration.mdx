# Server Configuration

This guide explains how to configure your Gurotopia server and set up client connections.

## Hosts File Configuration

To connect to your local server, you must modify your system's **hosts** file to redirect Growtopia's servers to your local machine.

### Windows

1. Open Notepad as Administrator
2. Open the file: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
3. Add the following lines at the end:

```
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```

4. Save the file

<Callout type="warn">
You need administrator privileges to edit the hosts file on Windows.
</Callout>

### Linux / macOS

1. Open terminal
2. Edit the hosts file with sudo:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

3. Add the following lines:

```
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```

4. Save with `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`

## Reverting Changes

To connect to official Growtopia servers again, remove or comment out the lines you added to the hosts file:

```
# 127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
# 127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```
