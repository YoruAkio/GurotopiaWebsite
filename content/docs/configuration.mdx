# Server Configuration

This guide explains how to configure your Gurotopia server and set up client connections.

## Hosts File Configuration

To connect to your local server, you must modify your system's **hosts** file to redirect Growtopia's servers to your local machine.

### Windows

1. Open Notepad as Administrator
2. Open the file: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
3. Add the following lines at the end:

```
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```

4. Save the file

<Callout type="warn">
You need administrator privileges to edit the hosts file on Windows.
</Callout>

### Linux / macOS

1. Open terminal
2. Edit the hosts file with sudo:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

3. Add the following lines:

```
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```

4. Save with `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`

## Server File Configuration

The server configuration is managed through the `server_data.php` file. This file is automatically created with default values on first run if it doesn't exist.

### Configuration Options

The `server_data.php` file contains the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `server` | Server IP address | `127.0.0.1` |
| `port` | Server port number | `17091` |
| `type` | Server type identifier | `1` |
| `type2` | Secondary server type identifier | `1` |
| `maint` | Maintenance message displayed when server is under maintenance | `Server under maintenance. Please try again later.` |
| `loginurl` | Login server URL | `login-gurotopia.vercel.app` |
| `meta` | Server metadata identifier | `gurotopia` |

### Example Configuration

```php
server|127.0.0.1
port|17091
type|1
type2|1
#maint|Server under maintenance. Please try again later.
loginurl|login-gurotopia.vercel.app
meta|gurotopia
RTENDMARKERBS1001
```

<Callout type="info">
Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and won't affect the configuration. The file must end with `RTENDMARKERBS1001` to be properly parsed.
</Callout>

### Editing the Configuration

1. Open the `server_data.php` file in a text editor
2. Modify the desired configuration values
3. Save the file
4. Restart the server for changes to take effect

## Reverting Changes

To connect to official Growtopia servers again, remove or comment out the lines you added to the hosts file:

```
# 127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
# 127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
```
